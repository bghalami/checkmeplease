## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choosing:
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:GhostGroup/api-test-beng.git
  ```
2. Navigate into the new directory.
3.  Merge my Dev branch

```shell
  git pull origin dev
  ```
4. Install the dependencies:
  ```shell
  bundle install
  ```
  5. Run the following command to create, migrate, and seed the database
  ```shell
  rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
  ```

## Running the Test Suite

1. After `Initial Setup` run
```shell
rspec
```

2. To see test coverage run
```shell
open coverage/index.html
```

## Running the Server Locally

To see your code in action locally, you need to fire up a development server. From the root of the project  
use the command:

```shell
rails server
```

Once the server is running, visit in your browser, or with [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/):

* `http://localhost:3000/` to run your application.

* The DB should be populated with 3 test Users for you to play around with

* To quit the server simply press Ctrl + C to shut it down.
